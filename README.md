Bulk Import (module for Omeka S)
================================

> than the previous repository.__

[Bulk Import] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to import any type of source
and is built to be extensible. It allows to manage importers and to process bulk
import of resources.

It manages readers of a source (xml, sql, spreadsheet, url…) and uses processors
to import them as Omeka resources and other data (users, templates…) via a
mapping.

Because multiple importers can be prepared with the same readers and processors,
it is possible to import multiple times the same type of files without needing
to do the mapping each time.

Default readers are Omeka S reader (via the api json endpoint), xml (via
transformation with xsl), [Spip] reader (via a dump of the database), and
spreadsheet reader (via ods, tsv or csv). The spreadsheet uses a processor that
creates resources based on a user-defined based on a specific header format,
unlike the module [CSV Import].


Installation
------------

This module requires the module [Log] and optionnaly [Generic]. An external xslt 2
processor may be needed if you import xml files that are not importable with
xlt 1. Some specific readers or processors may need some other modules.

**Important**: If you use the module [CSVImport] in parallel, you should apply
[this patch] or use [this version].

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

* From the zip

Download the last release [BulkImport.zip] from the list of releases, and
uncompress it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `BulkImport`, go to the root of the module, and run:

```sh
composer install --no-dev
```

Then install it like any other Omeka module.

* Files extensions

For security reasons, the plugin checks the extension of each ingested file. So,
if you import specific files, in particular XML metadata files and json ones,
they should be allowed in the page `/admin/setting`.

* XSLT processor

The xslt processor is only needed to import xml files that are not formatted as
flat ressources.

Xslt has two main versions:  xslt 1.0 and xslt 2.0. The first is often installed
with php via the extension `php-xsl` or the package `php5-xsl`, depending on
your system. It is until ten times slower than xslt 2.0 and sheets are more
complex to write.

So it’s recommended to install an xslt 2 processor, that can process xslt 1.0
and xslt 2.0 sheets. The command can be configured in the configuration page of
the plugin. Use "%1$s", "%2$s", "%3$s", without escape, for the file input, the
stylesheet, and the output.

Examples for Debian 6+ / Ubuntu / Mint (with the package "libsaxonb-java"):
```
saxonb-xslt -ext:on -versionmsg:off -warnings:silent -s:%1$s -xsl:%2$s -o:%3$s
```

Examples for Debian 8+ / Ubuntu / Mint (with the package "libsaxonhe-java"):
```
CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/Saxon-HE.jar java net.sf.saxon.Transform -ext:on -versionmsg:off -warnings:silent -s:%1$s -xsl:%2$s -o:%3$s
```

Example for Fedora / RedHat / Centos / Mandriva / Mageia (package "saxon"):
```
java -cp /usr/share/java/saxon.jar net.sf.saxon.Transform -ext:on -versionmsg:off -warnings:silent -s:%1$s -xsl:%2$s -o:%3$s
```

Or with packages "saxon", "saxon-scripts", "xml-commons-apis" and "xerces-j2":
```
saxon -ext:on -versionmsg:off -warnings:silent -s:%1$s -xsl:%2$s -o:%3$s
```

Note: Only saxon is currently supported as xslt 2 processor. Because Saxon is a
Java tool, a JRE should be installed, for example `openjdk-11-jre-headless` or
upper (or use `default-jre`).

Note: Warnings are processed as errors. That’s why the parameter "-warnings:silent"
is important to be able to process an import with a bad xsl sheet. It can be
removed with default xsl, that doesn’t warn anything.

Anyway, if there is no xslt2 processor installed, the command field should be
cleared. The plugin will use the default xslt 1 processor of php, if installed.


Quick start
-----------

First, define an importer, that is a reader and a processor. By default, they
are only one.

Then, config the reader and the processor.

Finally, process the import.


Omeka S
-------

Simply set the endpoint and eventually the credentials and run it. All data are
fetch: vocabularies, resource templates, assets and of course items, item sets
and media. Custom vocabs are imported too. It is recommended to have the same
modules installed, in particular those that add new data types (Value Suggest,
Numeric Data Types, Rdf Data Types, Data Type Geometry).
Specific metadata of other modules are currently not managed.


Spip
-------

Simply set the database credentials and  the endpoint and go on. You need to
install some more modules: [Advanced Resource Template], [Article], [Custom Vocab],
[Data Type Rdf], [Numeric Data Types], [Spip ], [Thesaurus], [User Profile].


Spreadsheet
-----------

To import a spreadsheet, choose its format and the multivalue separator if any.
Then do the mapping. The mapping is automatic when the header are properties
label, or existing terms, or Omeka metadata names, or existing keywords.

The header can have a language (with `@language`), a datatype (with `^^datatype`)
and a visibility (with `§private`).
For example to import a French title, use header `Title @fr` or `dcterms:title @fr`.
To import a relation as an uri, use header `Relation ^^uri` or `dcterms:relation ^^uri`.
To import an uri with a label, the value should be the uri, a space and the label.
To import a value as an Omeka resource, use header `Relation ^^resource`. The
value should be the internal id or a resource identifier (generally dcterms:identifier).
To import a custom vocab value, the header should contain `^^customvocab:xxx`,
where "xxx" is the identifier of the vocab or its label without spaces.
To import multiple targets for a column, use the separator "|" in the header.
Note that if there may be multiple properties, only the first language and type
will be used. It allows to keep consistency in the metadata.

Media can be imported with the item. The mapping is automatic with headers `Media url`,
`Media html`, etc.


### Internal differences with Csv Import

- Two columns with the same headers should be mapped the same.
- Empty values for boolean metadata (is_public…) in spreadsheet reader are
  skipped and they don't mean "false" or "true".
- In case of insensitive duplicate, the first one is always returned.


TODO
----

- [ ] Full dry-run.
- [ ] Fix numeric data type (doctrine issue).
- [ ] Distinction between skipped and blank (for spreadsheet).
- [ ] Update for module Mapping.
- [ ] Import of users, in particular for Omeka S import.
- [x] Import of uri with label in spreadsheet.
- [ ] Import of uri with label in value suggest.
- [ ] Skip import of vocabularies and resource templates for Omeka S import.
- [ ] Add check, in particular with multi-sheets.
- [ ] Manage import of Custom vocab with items.
- [ ] Why are there 752 missing ids with direct sql creation in Spip?
- [ ] Spip: Utiliser la langue de la rubrique supérieure si pas de langue.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
